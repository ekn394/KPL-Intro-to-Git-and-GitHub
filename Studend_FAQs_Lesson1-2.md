Q: The videos show opening files in Sublime Text (version 2) from the command line, but their instructions don't work for me? What should I do?  

A: Don't stress out about which code editor you use. Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or just plain Notepad. 
If you wanted to be able to launch a good coding text editor from Git Bash, I recommend downloading and installing <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"> Visual Studio Code</a>. 
<p>Then, you can use the word <code> code </code> and then the name of the file you want to open. This will launch Visual Studio Code with that file open.

## Lesson 2

Q: "Working on #11 ("Finding a bug"), but I can't play the game by clicking on the 'Play the Game Here' link."

A: In #10 ("Cloning a New Repository"), you had to use <code>git clone</code> to download a copy of the game's git repository.

Then, if you navigate to that freshly downloaded folder, there is a file in there (index.htm) that will launch the game in your webbrowser.
